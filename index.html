                      Hello World! I'm Steven Rostkowski! I am a very energetic person who is constantly looking for the next thing to conquer.  I have a both an undergraduate and graduate degree in biology.  My studies focused around the biogeochemistry.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      My primary interests are sports, playing video games, going to the gym, hanging out with my friends, and volunteering at charity events.  I am a huge Atlanta United fan and I am a proud member of the footie mob.  I have just started playing World of Warcraft again.  My next volunteering event is the Thanksgiving day Turkey Trot.

                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Traveling is one of the most important things in my life.  My first experience traveling abroad was a 5-week trip to Europe with three of my friends.  Our journey started in London and we ended up going to Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Lucerne, Rome, Venice, Milan, Nice, and back to London.  It was one of the most influencial experiences of a lifetime.
